# Intro
Our team: A.Gelgor, T.Lavrukhin, Khuc T.B., Nguen T.H.F., I.Petrov, is focused on investigation of **sprectral efficient modulation**.
The concept of our investigation is in *5G* sphere, but it can be easy scaled on other standards with FDM.
There are 2 main directions of our task:
1. *Non-orthogonal FDM* - convergence of subcarriers: SEFDM, PR-SEFDM.
2. *Pseudo-orthogonal FDM* - OFDM tuning with moderate formating scheme: FBMC, GFDM.
# Model
Our model is written in **MATLAB 2020b**.
- For run *simulation* you need setup file and run Main() function.
- For run *performance simulation* you need to run RegressionTest.m script.
